Hello, to perform the Edge Response analysis you will be asked to select the following files: 
1) a species abundance matrix, please refer to help manual for format. abundances may be normalised 
2) a list of census point coordinates, either lat / lon or x/y, in a specific format, please refer to manual for format info 
3) a projected map of your landscape in GeoTIFF format. The map should contain continuous variations of a single variable (e.g. Tree Cover, NDVI or LAI) representing habitat suitability, scaled from 0 to 100. Categorical maps should be transformed to fit this format, please refer to manual 
4) optional: a binary map in GeoTIFF format where 1 = non habitat (e.g. water, road, urban, and 0 = any natural habitat (grassland, plantation, forest..) 
Press OK if your input files are in the correct format and you wish to proceed, otherwise Cancel
